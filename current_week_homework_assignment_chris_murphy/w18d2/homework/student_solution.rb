# Hello World
# Print "Hello World" to the console
p "Hello World"
# After you have printed Hello World:
adjective = "Big Bad"

# Interpolate the adjective variable into the Hello World string using #{}
# Expected output:
p "Hello #{adjective} World"
# => Hello Big Bad World
# Save "Hello World" to a variable. Without changing the letters in your code manually, permanently change "Hello World" to all uppercased letters.
